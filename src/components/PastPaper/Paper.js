They provide an opportunity to practice and refine the skills required for success in assessments. Past Papers allow students to become familiar with the format of the exam, the type of questions that may be asked, and the level of detail required in their responses. Additionally, past papers can help students identify areas where they may need additional support or clarification. By reviewing past papers, students can gain confidence in their abilities and improve their chances of achieving their academic goals. Therefore, it is imperative that students make past papers a critical part of their exam preparation.</p>
